"This is my second Python Project I have created in my own time.  
This program will run a bingo game with 4 game cards.  These cards are generated 
using a random number generator within the certain standard number ranges used 
in standard Bingo.  There are multiple selectable win conditions that you can 
choose from, and you can even choose multiple if you'd like.  For example, you 
can choose to win by either getting the traditional horizontal, vertical, and 
diagonal, or you can even add 4 corners if you'd like.  The game will keep track 
of all the numbers you have entered, and will change the numbers to green when 
they have been picked.  Once you win on a card, it will notify you which card you 
won on and how."
